Moreover I will be drawing experience from various theoretical courses including Advance Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Interaction Design, UX Design, Advanced Web Development and many more.
                      Furthermore I will relate them with my professional work experiences.
                      I will share my design philosophy and how I wish to approach a design problem in the future.</p>
                    <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                      <h5><br>1. Put Users First</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30"> 
                        One of the most important principles I learned early on is to empathize and understand, by putting myself into the clients shoes. By striving to understand the user, I could take a big leap forward by identifying the real problem.                      <br>
                        Acknowledge and accept that your users may not be able to communicate their issues effectively. 
                      </p>  
                        <blockquote>Designers are trained to discover the real problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem. <b>— Don Norman, Design of Everyday Things </b>
                      </blockquote>
                      
                      <p class="mb-30 experience"> 
                        <b>My Experience:</b> In my case during my time at <a href="https://adityamawlankar.github.io/freshtrackscanada.io/freshtrackscanada.html"> <u>Fresh Tracks Canada</u></a>, we conducted structured interviews early on to empathize what the users look for once they land on the website. These valuable insights were then put forth towards actionable steps.

                        <h5><br>2. Try to be Limitless during Ideation </h5>
                        <p class="mb-30"> 
                          When it comes to ideation don’t get limited by the tools available for execution, be ambitious and Ideate as if you have all the resources in the world. What this does is allows you to think outside of the box. This is what gives rise to Innovation and creativity by thinking outside of the box rather than reinventing the wheel.
                          After initial brainstorming is done , encourage critique and feedback in the team. Get input from the stakeholders to make sure you are on track. 
                          If you are short on ideas, look for competitors and try to find what’s working and how it could be made better.

                        My Experience: During my time at <a href="https://adityamawlankar.github.io/freshtrackscanada.io/freshtrackscanada.html"> <u>Fresh Tracks Canada</u></a>, I began sketching wireframes and interactive components for different layouts (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop). These were then built into prototypes and tested using a lean design process: Research, Design, Test, Iterate.

                        <p class="mb-30"> 
                          This is extremely important and I learned it in later stages of my professional career, if you can’t explain the design decisions in 1 or 2 sentences, then you don’t understand it and neither would the user.  
                          This meant instructing the UX designer to design clean and simple layouts with use of contrast and ease of accessibility. 
                          Moreover, with an increasing list of competitors leveraging social media for presence I believe designs should not only be used to grab user attention but also user retention which would significantly boost customer presence on the platform and allow them to flow down the customer funnel.

                        <p class="mb-30"> 
                          Prioritize and set clean and clear goals with a list of milestones for the week. i.e short term goals(tasks) for the day and long term goals(tasks) for the week. Addition of short & long term goals would make it a productive month and get closer to your target.
                        </p>  
                        
                        <p class="mb-30 experience">

                    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
                    <p class="mb-30">I claim no expertise, but after this course, I am glad that I am starting to form my own opinions about what good design entails. Design thinking is messy and having clarity and designing with a vision of future is essential to craft seamless experiences rather than designing from past memories. It enables me to really understand the problem at hand and make justifiable compromises. I believe a good design does not necessarily involve an overly engineered solution. However, you need to follow the basics. Getting early feedback on your low-fidelity prototypes, coupled with good wireframing and usability testing can set you up for success.
